t-description: "Instead of using distant cloud data centers centers, there are ways to bring the cloud closer to the edge devices.  A cloud fog network (CFN) can be used for more energy-efficient processes. CFN supports an architecture where deep neural network models are processed in servers between end-devices and clouds. Yosuf et al (2018) present a architecture that consists of four layers: IoT end devices, Access Fog (AF), Metro Fog (MF) and Cloud datacenter (CDC)"
