t-description: "The emissions of machine learning are related to the used hardware. That is why using energy efficient hardware to run machine  models can reduce the power consumption of such a model. Energy efficient hardware could include low-energy components. For example the Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) developed by Google have be seen as an energy efficient alternative to the CPUs and GPUs "
