t-description: "Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that aims to train a shared ML model on decentralized devices. Instead of sending raw data to a central server, FL trains the model directly on the devices where the data is generated, such as mobile phones or edge devices. Only the trained data or updated model parameters are then sent to a central server. Federated learning decreases the resources needed for transferring large amounts of data to a central server, which results in improved energy efficiency."
