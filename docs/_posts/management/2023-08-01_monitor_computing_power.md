t-description: "Estimating and calculating the energy footprint of a machine learning model can help reducing the computational power of ML models. Monitoring the energy consumption of a ML model in long term helps identifying  those components where energy is being inefficiently utilized. That can serve a starting point for making improvements to reduce energy consumption. There has been a lack of easy-to-use tools to do that but recently some researchers have provided frameworks how to estimate or calculate the energy footprint of ML"
