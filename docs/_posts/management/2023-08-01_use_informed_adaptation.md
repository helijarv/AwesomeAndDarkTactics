t-description: " Machine learning models may experience drifts that affect their functionalities. In those cases, the models must be adapted to the drift. Informed adaptation refers to a method of adapting the ML model only when a drift is detected. Therefore the frequency of adaptation is smaller than in blind, regular adaptation. Informed adaptation reduces unnecessary adaptations which consequently saves energy"
