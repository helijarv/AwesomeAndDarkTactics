t-description: "The tactic of having an energy consumption constraint for model optimization means that the optimization process considers the energy consumption of the model during model tuning and training. Therefore the model is trained to stay under the threshold in terms of energy consumption. The model optimization is seen as a optimization problem and hyperparameters and model is optimized according to the predetermined energy consumption limits"

t-intent: "Use energy consumption as a predetermined constraint for HPO and model optimization. Thus the model will stay below the treshold."
