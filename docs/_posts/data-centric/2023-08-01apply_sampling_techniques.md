t-description: "The size of input data seems to have a positive correlation with the energy consumption of computing. Therefore reducing the size of input data can have a positive impact on energy-efficiency of ML. Reducing input data can be done by using only a subset of the original input data. This is called sampling. There are some different ways of conducting sampling (e.g. Simple random sampling or Systematic sampling), but Verdecchia et al. (2022) used stratified sampling which means randomly selecting datapoints from homogeneous subgroups of the original dataset (2022)."
