t-description: "Identifying and removing redundant data for ML models reduces computing time, number of computing, energy consumption and memory space. Redundant data refers to those datapoints that don’t improve the accuracy of the model. Thus, removing these unimportant datapoints doesn’t sacrifice much accuracy (Dhabe et al. 2021)"

t-intent: "Detecting and removing redundant data reduces the size of input data, which can result in less computation power"
t-targetQA: "Energy Efficiency"
t-relatedQA: "Accuracy, data representativeness"
t-measuredimpact: "Removing redundant data from the dataset reduces leads to a smaller input data that further decreases computations, computatuinal time, electricity and memory space"
