t-description: "Some algorithms may have light-weight alternatives. Using these lighter models can have a lower impact on the environment without a loss of important quality attributes. For example Sorbaro et a (2020), noted that Spiking neural networks is an altretnative for convolutional neural networks.  CNN can be converded to SNN without a significant loss of accuracy or performance"
