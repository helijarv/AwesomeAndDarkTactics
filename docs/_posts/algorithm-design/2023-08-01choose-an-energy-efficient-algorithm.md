t-description: "Different ML algorithms have different levels of energy consumption. For example, K-nearest neighbor algorithm has way higher energy consumption than Random Forest (Kaack et al., 2022).High energy consumption does not necessarily mean that those algorithms perform better or achieve higher accuracy levels than low-energy algorithms. Thus, choosing a suitable, energy efficient algorithms that achieve wanted outcomes can reduce the energy consumption of ML models (Kaack et al., 2022)"
